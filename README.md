Pneumonia Detection using Computer Vision

## ***DOMAIN: Health Care***

## **CONTEXT:**
Computer vision can be used in health care for identifying diseases. In Pneumonia detection we need to detect Inflammation
of the lungs. In this challenge, you’re required to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical
images. Specifically, your algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.

### **DATA DESCRIPTION:**
- In the dataset, some of the features are labeled “Not Normal No Lung Opacity”. This extra third class indicates that while pneumonia was
determined not to be present, there was nonetheless some type of abnormality on the image and oftentimes this finding may mimic the
appearance of true pneumonia. Dicom original images: - Medical images are stored in a special format called DICOM files (*.dcm). They
contain a combination of header metadata as well as underlying raw image arrays for pixel data.

### **PROJECT OBJECTIVE**:
Design a Deep Learning based algorithm for detecting pneumonia.
